#### DEPENDENCIES ####
Badnik have been developped on Fedora 20 and have been tested with Python 3.3 and GTK+ 3.8.

I don't plan to support older versions of these softwares.

Badnik also uses libgd but isn't currently delivered with it so you currently need to have GNOME Documents installed (it is planned to deliver libgd with Badnik in the future).

#### INSTALLATION ####

To install Badnik type from the project's directory :
make install

You can set the installation directory by modifying the prefix variable (/usr/local by default) :
make install prefix=/usr
